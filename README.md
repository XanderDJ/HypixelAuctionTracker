# HypixelAuctionTracker

This project will get the active items on the hypixel skyblock auctions and store them into a mongoDB. Using this data many interesting statistics can be visualized and used in a website for skyblock players.

The most simple statistic and the reason I started this project was figuring out the average value of a certain item on the auction. This way you can make sure you're not overpaying if you're not in direct need of something.
